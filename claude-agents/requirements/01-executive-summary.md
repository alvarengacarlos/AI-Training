# Executive Summary

## Project Name
Muay Thai Gym Management System (MTGMS)

## Document Version
Version 1.0 - October 16, 2025

## Project Overview

The Muay Thai Gym Management System is a multi-tenant SaaS web application designed to streamline administrative operations for Muay Thai gyms in Brazil. The system enables gym owners and administrators to efficiently manage teachers, students, classes, and payment tracking through a centralized, cloud-based platform.

## Business Context

Muay Thai gym owners currently face challenges managing their operations manually or through inadequate tools. They need a cost-effective solution that handles:
- Student enrollment and class management
- Teacher scheduling and assignment
- Payment tracking with flexible billing cycles
- Multi-gym operations for franchise or multi-location businesses

The MTGMS addresses these pain points by providing a streamlined, affordable solution specifically tailored to martial arts gym operations.

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce administrative burden by centralizing gym management tasks in one system
2. **Payment Visibility**: Provide clear tracking of student payments with immediate status indicators
3. **Cost Effectiveness**: Deliver full functionality within a $100/month infrastructure budget
4. **Accessibility**: Enable gym administrators to manage operations from any device through responsive web interface
5. **Multi-Tenant Support**: Allow root users to manage multiple gym locations from a single platform

### Success Criteria
- System supports up to 100 simultaneous users with acceptable performance
- Gym administrators can complete common tasks (student enrollment, payment tracking) in under 2 minutes
- Infrastructure costs remain under $100/month
- System achieves 99% uptime during business hours (6am-10pm BRT)
- LGPD compliance for all personal data storage and processing

## High-Level Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- Multi-tenant gym management with isolated data per gym
- Teacher management (profiles, schedules, class assignments)
- Student management (profiles, class enrollments, variable pricing)
- Class management (scheduling, capacity limits, teacher assignments)
- Payment tracking (history, due dates, status indicators, offline payments)
- Admin dashboard (student count, schedule overview)
- Basic authentication (username/password)
- Notification system (SMS/WhatsApp for overdue payments) - Nice to Have

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Attendance tracking and reporting
- Payment processing integrations (Stripe, PagSeguro)
- Student/teacher self-service portals
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Multi-factor authentication
- Automated student consent management
- Waitlist functionality

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Gym Owners**: Business decision makers who will purchase and implement the system
- **Gym Administrators**: Daily users who manage operations (may be the same as owners)
- **Root Users**: System administrators managing multi-gym deployments

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Teachers**: Indirectly affected through schedule assignments (no system access)
- **Students**: Indirectly affected through enrollment and payment tracking (no system access)
- **Development Team**: Responsible for system implementation and maintenance

## Business Value

### Cost Savings
- Reduces manual administrative time by approximately 10-15 hours per week per gym
- Eliminates need for expensive, complex enterprise systems
- Prevents revenue loss from missed or forgotten payment tracking

### Revenue Protection
- Clear payment status indicators prevent revenue leakage
- Historical payment tracking enables better financial planning
- Flexible billing cycles accommodate diverse student payment preferences

### Competitive Advantages
- Purpose-built for martial arts gym operations (not generic CRM)
- Affordable pricing model suitable for small to medium gyms
- Brazilian market focus with LGPD compliance built-in
- Multi-tenant architecture supports gym franchises and chains

## Project Constraints

### Budget Constraints
- Maximum infrastructure cost: $100/month
- Must utilize cost-effective cloud services
- Minimal third-party service dependencies

### Technical Constraints
- Web-based application (no native mobile apps)
- Must support Firefox, Edge, and Google Chrome browsers
- Responsive design required for mobile access
- Maximum 100 simultaneous users supported

### Timeline Constraints
- MVP delivery prioritizes core functionality over advanced features
- Notification system deferred as nice-to-have feature

### Regulatory Constraints
- Full compliance with Brazilian LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados)
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure storage of personal data

## Risk Assessment

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Performance Under Load**: 100 simultaneous users may stress budget infrastructure
   - Mitigation: Implement efficient database queries and caching strategies

2. **LGPD Compliance**: Failure to comply could result in legal penalties
   - Mitigation: Implement data encryption, secure authentication, and proper data handling

3. **Budget Overrun**: Infrastructure costs exceeding $100/month
   - Mitigation: Use serverless architecture and monitor resource utilization closely

### Medium-Priority Risks
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Inconsistent behavior across browsers
   - Mitigation: Test on all supported browsers during development

2. **Data Loss**: System failure resulting in data loss
   - Mitigation: Implement automated backups and disaster recovery procedures

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Outcomes
- 100% of student payment statuses visible at-a-glance
- 50% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks
- Zero missed payments due to tracking failures
- 99% system uptime during business hours

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Improved gym administrator satisfaction and confidence
- Better visibility into gym operations and financial health
- Professional system that enhances gym's brand image
- Foundation for future feature expansion

## Next Steps

1. **Requirements Review**: Stakeholder validation of this requirements documentation
2. **Technical Architecture**: Design system architecture within budget constraints
3. **Development Planning**: Break down requirements into implementation sprints
4. **Prototype Development**: Build core functionality for validation
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate system with real gym administrators
6. **Deployment**: Launch MVP to production environment
7. **Monitoring**: Track usage, performance, and gather feedback for improvements
